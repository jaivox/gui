(sir, how would you like an amazing Jinsu knife?) (what does it do?)
	(well, it cuts through anything) (oh really)
		(well let me demonstrate on this pipe) (but I am not cutting pipes)
	(well, it is the sharpeset knife ever) (is it diamond-tipped)
		(diamond tips are not for knives) (but I use it to cut steel)
			(this never needs sharpening) (probably because you dont use it)
				(sir, how about a free trial?) (no thanks, I have to go)
	(it does anything you want) (how about making salesmen go away)
		(very funny sir, but you do cut things?) (yes, salesmen)
