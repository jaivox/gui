(hello, I am from the local farm division) (I am busy)
(i am here to advise you on crops) (I do not have any crops)
	(then what do I see growing here?) (that is an orchard young man)
		(well that is a crop) (and a fungus is a tree, go away)
	(we can advise you on your farm) (I do not need any advise)
		(do you use scientific methods?) (I use methods that work)
			(i doubt if this tree will have any peaches) (I will also be suprised)
				(then you need my help) (no you need to know that is a pear tree)
