(that is an unusual house) (it is an earth friendly design)
	(what does that mean) (it is designed to use prevailing winds)
		(so it does not have airconditioning) (it does, but not too much)
			(I like it cold) (well, it is not going to be that cold)
		(does it use a heat pump?) (it uses mostly solar heating)
	(I bet it is expensive) (this one yes, but in quantity, no)
		(how much does it cost) (this one costs about 300 thousand)
			(that is a bit too much) (a smaller house would be less)
