(hello, I am calling about getting car insurance) (I can help you with that)
(I have two cars, about three years old) (how many drivers?)
	(just the two of us) (you and your husband?)
		(yes) (did either of you have an accident recently?)
			(no) (how about moving violations?)
				(no) (well then we can probably get good rates)
		(no it my son and I) (how old is your son?)
			(he is twenty) (well rates for young men are high)
				(that is too bad) (but we can get the best available)
