<h1>Dump Button</h1>
The Dump button dumps, i.e. writes all the information in the tree to
files. This is then used to create speech recognizers that follow the
conversation created in the gui.
<p>
Since the user interface creates a tree with many options, the file
that is created by the dump button is suitable for the Jaivox interpreter.
However, since the syntax of this is important to later processing stages,
it is best not to modify this file.
<p>
The information from the dump button is overwritten when specifications
in the user interface are changed.
