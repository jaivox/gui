<p>
You can create dialogs containing words from databases. For example suppose
you want to ask "is X the best airline to Hawaii?" X could be replaced with
names of various airlines. This list of names can come from a column of
a database. The Select DB button lets you select a database that contains
such information.
</p><p>
At present, you can connect to databases through a JDBC interface. At present
you can select MySql (or MariaDB) and Postgres databases. You can add support
for more databases by modifying the com.jaivox.ui.db package.
