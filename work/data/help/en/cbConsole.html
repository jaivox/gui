<h1>Console Option</h1>
<p>
Choose this option to create applications that do not need a recognizer
or a synthesizer. Instead, you ask questions by typing them, and the answers
are also printed out on the screen.
</p><p>
The console option is the easiest to use when testing an application, since you 
just have to type in the input and read the output; this is especially useful 
if you do not speak the target language of the application fluently.
