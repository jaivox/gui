<h1>Generated Sentences</h1>
<p>
This list shows all the sentences that are created using synonyms found
in the synonyms table.

This is not an editable list (as of now.) If you want to have new sentences
you should either modify the synonyms table, or (for completely different
sentences), you should modify the <a href="dialogTree.html">dialog tree.</a>
