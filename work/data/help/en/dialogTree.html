<h1>Dialog Tree</h1>
<p>
This tree shows the structure of a conversation between a user and the system.
Generally the user speaks first, and the system answers. The answer appears as
below the question. In tree terminology, the answer is a <em>child</em> of
the question.
</p><p>
The user may ask a follow-up question after hearing the answer. This follow-up
question then appears as a child of the original answer. The answer to the
follow-up question will be a child of the follow-up question.
</p><p>
The dialog tree can be modified at any of the questions or answers by right-clicking
on the question or answer and adding new children.
