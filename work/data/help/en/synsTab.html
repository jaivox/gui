<h1>Synonyms Table</h1>
<p>
When you select any line in the <a href="dialogTree.html">dialog tree</a>,
that sentence is just one of many ways to ask or answer the same thing. One
method to get other forms of sentences is to replace some of the words in
the original sentence. The synonyms table finds possible synonyms using
a thesaurus, for English it uses wordnet.
</p><p>
You can select or deselect the options that are presented. You can also add
new synonyms by adding a row (right click on the last row, and select Add Row
from the popup menu.
</p><p>
The synonyms table also parses the sentences in the dialog tree using an
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/lex-parser.shtml">open source statistical 
parser.</a> Synonyms that are found from thesaurus are substituted in the sentence
to see if the parse is still the same. However the parser is not always correct.
For example, in the sentence "are the roads smooth?" the parser may interpret
"smooth" as a verb.
