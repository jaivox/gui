<h1>Google Synthesizer</h1>
<p>
You can use the Google Synthesizer or "Text to Speech" to speak responses
from the speech recognition application.
The name should be a single word. For example, you could have an application
named "salesperson" but not one named "sales person" (that would be two words,
you need to use a single word.)
</p><p>
The Google Synthesizer produces fairly high quality speech, however for a detailed
review of its capabilities for many languages, please see
<a href="http://www.jaivox.com/googletts.html">Testing Google's Text to Speech.</a>
</p><p>
This speech synthesizer is supported by the com.jaivox.synthesizer.web
library. However, you also need to install

JLayer from Javazoom.</a>
