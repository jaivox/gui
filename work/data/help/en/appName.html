<h1>Application Name</h1>
<p>
The name should be a single word. For example, you could have an application
named "salesperson" but not one named "sales person" (that would be two words,
you need to use a single word.)
</p><p>
The application name is used when generating files. The names of the generated
files is usually the application name followed by something else. For example,
if the application name is "buyer" the dialog file may be "buyer.dlg".
