<h1>Expand Synonyms</h1>
<p>
This application can attempt to generalize questions and answers by substituing
synonyms for some of the words in a sentence. This substitution is now available
only for Egnlish. Wordnet is used to find synonyms. A parser is used to check if
the substitution changes the grammar (substitution is rejected if the grammar
structure is changed.) Normally this button is unselected.

<b>Important</b>. If you want to expand synonyms, press this button <b>before</b>
loading your tree.
