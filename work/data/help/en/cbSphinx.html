<h1>Sphinx Recognizer</h1>
<p>
Sphinx, or CMU Sphinx, is an open source speech recognizer from the Speech
Group at Carnegie Mellon University. In our experience, this recognizer does
not work as well as the <a href="cbGoogleRecognizer.html">Google Recognizer</a>
but the Google recognizer is not open source unlike Sphinx.
</p><p>
We have also found that the Sphinx recognizer seems to work best using a
noise cancelling microphone.
</p><p>
If you use the Sphinx recognizer, you will need to download and install several
Sphinx related packages. You can see more details about that from
<a href="http://www.jaivox.com/download.html">Jaivox download page</a>.
