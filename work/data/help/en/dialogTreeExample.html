<h1>Example of a Dialog Tree</h1>
<p>
This is an example of how a dialog may be considered as a tree. To keep it
somewhat simple, the questions and corresponding answers are given one line.
(In the dialog tree, the answer is a child of the question.) Follow up questions
and answers appear at a later level of the tree.

This dialog deals with a conversation between a user and a system
acting as a medical professional.
<pre>
IF user = i am feeling sick THEN System = do you feel hot and THEN
  IF user = a little THEN System = is your nose runny and THEN
    IF user = yes THEN System = how is your throat and THEN
      IF user = itchy THEN System = it is probably just a cold
      ELSE IF user = hurts THEN System = could be an infection. are you coughing and THEN
        IF user = a lot THEN System = go to a doctor
        ELSE IF user = a little THEN System = may be best to go to a doctor
        ELSE IF user = no THEN System = try drinking some fluids
      ELSE IF user = fine THEN System = are you wheezing and THEN
        IF user = yes THEN System = a lot or just a little and THEN
          IF user = a lot THEN System = could be asthma
          ELSE IF user = a little THEN System = could be allergies
    ELSE IF user = no THEN System = do you feel congested and THEN
      IF user = yes THEN System = did you have a cold earlier and THEN
