<h1>Google Recognizer</h1>
<p>
Most of us know about Google's speech recognizers through voice search.
There is an unofficial API (for now, 2013) that can be accessed through
other programs. This API supports many languages also.
</p><p>
One way to use the API is through Jaivox's com.jaivox.recognizer.web
interface (which can be modified to fit any web-based recognizer, not just
Google's.) This will convert live speech into FLAC format files that are
submitted for recognition.
</p><p>
One advantage of selecting the Google recognizer is that you can immediately
test your dialog design by connecting online (so long as the unofficial API
is available.) But the Google recognizer is not open source, unlike the
