<h1>Qualitative Databases</h1>
<p>
A qualitative database associates things with qualitative measurements. This
helps when you have to answer questions that contain adjectives. For example,
suppose you want to ask "which washing machine is the best?", you can compare
and judge washing machines from a database where each washing machine is given
a score (say, between 0 and 100).
</p><p>
Qualitative databases are used the same way as ordinary databases. They also
contain columns that can substitute for words in questions or answers as
in <a href="selectDbButton.html">databases.</a>
</p><p>
Qualitative databases are usually created by analyzing real databases. For
example, the scores like "best places to live" or "best colleges" are made
by combining many actual measurements such as costs and circumstances.
